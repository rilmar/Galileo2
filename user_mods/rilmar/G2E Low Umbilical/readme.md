# G2E Low Umbilical
I've found that Stealthburner toolhead boards like the SB2209 work best on an Enderwire/Switchwire setup when the umbilical leaves in the middle rear and low enough to not interfere with belts in the z direction.

This is a remix of [Hartk's umbilical mount](../../hartk/G2E_Umbilical/readme.md) to relocate the PG7 gland to provide a different orientation that aligns better with an enderwire conversion.

The spacers are the same with only the PG7 mount being altered.
